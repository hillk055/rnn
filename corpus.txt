The evening sun spilled gold across the valley. A soft wind moved through the tall grass, whispering secrets of the day that had passed. In the distance, a small village rested at the foot of the hills, its rooftops glowing like embers.

Elara walked the dirt path home, her satchel filled with wild herbs and the smell of pine on her hands. The sky was deepening to violet, and the first stars blinked awake one by one. Somewhere behind her, an owl called out — slow, deliberate, ancient.

She paused at the bridge, where the river divided the world into reflection and reality. For a moment she watched her own face shimmer on the surface, and wondered which side of the water was truly her own.

A sound broke the stillness. Hoofbeats, light but urgent, echoing down the path. She turned. A rider in a dark cloak approached, carrying something wrapped in cloth. When the horse stopped, the rider spoke softly.

"Are you Elara, the healer’s daughter?"

Elara nodded. The rider lifted the cloth, revealing a faint blue glow — a crystal pulsing like a heartbeat.

"It’s fading," he said. "And if it dies, the mountain sleeps forever."

Elara looked up at the stars again, then back at the crystal. She didn’t understand what it meant, not yet. But she felt the pull of something larger than herself — a beginning disguised as an ending.

So she took the crystal, held it close to her chest, and stepped into the night.
